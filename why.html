  <h1>Why this project</h1>
<p>That's now a few years that we are entertained about the risks of having all our privacy exposed. The main risk being the difficulties to fight back the sliding of a democracy into a totalitarian regime. What we do in our private time is what gives us the ability to prevent such a sliding.</p>

<p>We need tools easy to use that give to every citizen the ability to manage by himself his private datas. Those datas being stored at his home, or wherever he wants.</p>

<p>Such tools must satisfy the statement : "You are the only one able to give away information about yourself".</p>


  <h1>Example</h1>
<p>A good example is the PRISM project in which the NSA gets access to all the datas from most of the major web companies. The main issues being why does the American government needs all those datas about everybody. Why did it took a whistleblower for us to discover it.</p>

<p>The solution to this situation is of course political. We need to determine what is OK for governments to do and what is not.</p>

<p>Nevertheless even with those issues cleared we won't have any guaranties about what the secret services do and don't do. The only guaranty for us is to be the only one able to give away information about ourselves.</p>
