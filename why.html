  <h1>Why this project</h1>
<p>That's now a few years that we are intertaind about the risques of having all our privacy exposed. The main risqu being the difficulties to fight back the sliding of a democracie into a totalitarian regime. What we do in our private time is what gives us the ability to prevent such a sliding.</p>

<p>All that being sayed we need tools easy to use that give the ability to every citizen to manage himslelf his private datas. Thoses datas being stored at his home.</p>

<p>Such tools must satify the statement : "You are the only one able to give away information about yourself".</p>


  <h1>Exemple</h1>
<p>A good exemple is the PRISM project in wich the NSA gets access to all the datas from most of the magor web companies. The main issues being why does the american government needs all those datas about everybody. Why did it took a wissleblower for use to discover it.</p>

<p>The solution to this situation is of course political. We need to determine what is OK for governments to do and what is not.</p>

<p>Nevertheless even with thoses issues cleared we won't have any garanties about what the secret services do and don't do. The anly garanty for us is to be the only one able to give away information about ourself.</p>
